# TensorFloss #
## DeepLearningAPI ##

An API for building deep learning models on a remote server with a user-friendly interface. Utilizes Python Flask for the Front-End, Google Datastore as our main database, Celery to handle thread scheduling, and Tensorflow to handle back-end functionality for model development. 

To run the app first install the dependencies using 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then navigate to [`Flask/`](https://github.com/dsherma7/DeepLearningAPI/tree/master/Flask) and run 
`python3 run.py`
